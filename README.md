This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: a null object reference error when accessing properties of objects that might unexpectedly be null.  The `bug.as` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version with robust null checks.  This error is often tricky to debug due to its seemingly innocuous nature, and demonstrates the importance of careful null checks in event handlers and other parts of the application where object references are involved.  The solution highlights defensive programming techniques.
